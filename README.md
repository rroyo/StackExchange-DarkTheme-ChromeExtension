## Icons

The icons used in this extension were created by [Tal Revivo](https://iconscout.com/contributors/icon-54).

## Inspiration

The idea for adding the dark-theme class was suggested by [Cave Johnson](https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/299995/cave-johnson) on this [meta.stackexchange.com](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111399/dark-mode-for-stack-exchange-sites/342512#342512) thread.

### Note

After loading the extension for the first time, or when toggling the dark mode on dormant pages, you may need to refresh the page for changes to take effect.
This can be fixed, but I've chosen to keep permissions at a minimum.
